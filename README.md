- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am @DevOpsDrum, a.k.a. Mike. This account will hold [repos/projects](https://github.com/DevOpsDrum?tab=repositories) and [gists](https://gist.github.com/devopsdrum) I find helpful or have used for learning and training.
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in all things DevOps: automation, scripting, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring/alerting. I have primarily worked in the "Windows World" since 2004 and most of my experience is with Windows OS, PowerShell, and C#.
Since around 2018, I have been gaining experience with Azure, containerization, Kubernetes, linux, bash, golang, python, and I am constantly on the lookout for new and better ways of getting things done.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning Kubernetes and working towards an Azure certification.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madrum/)
